A "falling star" or a "shooting star" has nothing at all to do with a star! These amazing streaks of light you can sometimes see in the night sky are caused by tiny bits of dust and rock called meteoroids falling into the Earth's atmosphere and burning up. The short-lived trail of light the burning meteoroid produces is called a meteor. Meteors are commonly called falling stars or shooting stars. If any part of the meteoroid survives burning up and actually hits the Earth, that remaining bit is then called a meteorite. (NASA) <br /> <br />

This repo includes falling stars animation which just seem to come from part of the sky because of the way the Earth encounters the particles moving in the path of the comet's orbit. <br /> https://aslihana.github.io/falling-stars
